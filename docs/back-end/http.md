    Receiving a **_403_** response is the server telling you, “I’m sorry. I know who you are--I believe who you say you are--but you just don’t have permission to access this resource. Maybe if you ask the system administrator nicely, you’ll get permission. But please don’t bother me again until your predicament changes.”

    Receiving a **_401_** response is the server telling you, “you aren’t authenticated--either not authenticated at all or authenticated incorrectly--but please reauthenticate and try again.”
