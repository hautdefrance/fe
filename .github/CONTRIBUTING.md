# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- _**Quality and Practicality First**_.
- Unlike other awesome lists, this project hopes to try not to add description，which will keep the list clean. In general, the title of a chapter already reflects the purpose of the library, unless it is a project located under _**miscellaneous**_.
- If it's just a toy-level item, do not add it.
- If there is a useless project, Welcome open a PR to delete it.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Suggested packages should be tested and documented.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- New volumns, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
